        <h4>How to get started with AWS</h2>
        <p>Amazon Web Services is a powerful and affordable web service. 
           If you are interested in either creating a basic personal website or a puissant server, 
           AWS offers a large range of capabilities to help you with your project.</p>
        <p>The process of creating an AWS account is straightforward and more practical then you would expect.
           Amazon did a great job at covering the most important and relevant aspects of having an AWS account in the sign-up process.
           For whatever type of service you desire, AWS lists the functions and applications you might need for your project and what costs goes along with them.
           The most basic plan allows the user to build a basic interactive or static website for basically no fee, besides having to purchase your domain,
           a process which is technically optional since you can run your website as an AWS subdomain for free.</p> 
        <p>Once you are signed-up you will be introduced to the Console which lists AWS's numerous functions. If you are new to web services,
           the menu will be nothing but a mess of oddly-named menu items. Building a static or interactive website on AWS only requires you to use two or three  
           of these items, which tells a lot about the great range of AWS's capabilities. For a beginner, the <em>Additional Resources</em> 
           side menu might be of help. Click <em>Getting Started</em> to see descriptions of all of AWS' functions and applicatoins, 
           or for step-by-step tutorials of building a website in AWS.</p>
        <p>A personal note I would add concerning the IAM User: for a large project team, 
           the IAM User allows all the members of your team to use one AWS account and work on the same project together, or splitting up into different 
           teams by placing members in different groups like administration, development, and such. This tool is of great help in those situations but of no use 
           for a personal account, so do not feel obligated to create an IAM User (even though AWS might encourage it) if you are working on a personal project.</p>
